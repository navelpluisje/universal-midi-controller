# Universal Midi Controller

The idea is to create a tool that can emulate different controllers. Currently the controllers available are:

- Presonus FaderPort V2
- Presonus FaderPort 8
- Presonus FaderPort 16

## Run

- Checkout th repo
- run `yarn install` (https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/, please use version 1)
- run `yarn start`
- The MIDI device will appear as `NP Controller`
